Menus are a simple system that works as a flexable GUI,
All a menu is is a list of buttons, a title, and functions,
These functions are what make these menus usefull,
There are onOpen, onClose, onRender, and onClick functions
The general menu layout is this:

name: { the name of the menu
    cutCorners: true, if true all buttons will have their corner cut
    stage: 10, stage of the menu
    size: { size of the menu
        x: 500,
        y: 500
    },
    location: { the top left corner of the menu
        x: 100,
        y: 100
    },
    backgroundColor: [0,0,0,.75], the color of the menu background
    border: { an optional border around the menu
        width: .015, the width of the border 0-1
        color: [50,50,50,.75] the color of the border
    },
    title: { an optional object for a title
        text: "Menu text", text to display on the top of the menu
        color: [200,200,200], the color of the text
        size: .2, the max size the text can take up 0-1
        font: "Times" the font for the text
    },
    padding: .05, how much space between buttons 0-1
    buttons: [ an array of all the buttons
    {
        border: { an optional border for the button
            width: .1, how much of the button should be border 0-1
            color: [0,0,0,.75] the color of the button
        },
        color: [0,255,0], the color of the button
        title: { an optional title for the button
            text: "Button text", the text for said title
            color: [0,0,0] and the color of the text
        },
        functions: { all the functions that make it great, self is the button, menu is the menu
            onRender: function(self, menu) {}, runs before being rendered
            onClick: function(self, menu) {} runs when it is clicked
        }
    },
    ],
    functions: { the functions for the menu
        onRender: function(self, menu) {}, runs at the start of the render
        onOpen: function(self, menu) {},runs when Menu.open is called
        onClose: function(self, menu) {} runs when Menu.ckise is called
    }
}

The order of things being added to the renderStack and functions:

    menu onOpen()
    menu onRender()
    r+= menu background
    r+= menu border
    r+= menu title
    button onRender()
    r+= button background
    r+= button border
    r+= button text

Here are some usefull functions:

    goes in button onRender
    self.color = (self.targeted[3] ? .5 : 1)
    this will make the buttons darker looking when the mouse is over them
